# Practical Task 1

#Start
# request user to input first name and last name
# print out both names with concatenation
#request user's age and print it out
#print the string Hello World!

#request user's first and last name
first_name = input("Please enter your first name:")
last_name = input("Please enter your last name:")

#using the print statement and concatenation I combined the first and last name with a space inbetween 
print(first_name + " " + last_name)

#request user's age
Age = int(input("Please enter your age:"))

print(Age)

print("Hello World!")
